# Nechifor Web

## TODO

- Make sure to mark things that are generated as non-indexable by Google.

- Make sites accessible on Phones.

- Add Open Graph data: http://ogp.me/

- Add web monitoring.

- Should I use schema.org?

- Add more links between repos and sites and between sites and used packages.

- See if you can avoid installing so many packages related to nginx.

- Add a blog page about movie histograms with the small package I created. Show
  it for some popular films.

- Each site should have a link to the github page easily visible.

- Add script that creates a map of every link in the docker container. Use it to
  detect broken links.

- Use supervisord to keep both PHP and Nginx alive. See
  https://hub.docker.com/r/amontaigu/nginx-php/ for an example.

- Most of the sites are missing titles.

- Review **ALL** the files to make sure everything was converted okay.
