# Nechifor Web

## TODO

- Make sure to mark things that are generated as non-indexable by Google.

- Make sites accessible on Phones.

- Add Open Graph data: http://ogp.me/

- Add web monitoring.

- Should I use schema.org?

- Add more links between repos and sites and between sites and used packages.

- See if you can avoid installing so many packages related to nginx.

- Add a blog page about movie histograms with the small package I created. Show
  it for some popular films.

- Each site should have a link to the github page easily visible.
